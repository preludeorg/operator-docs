Enterprise users can link Operator with their AWS account to deploy and manage disposable [redirectors](doc:redirector)  in their cloud environment. Cloud redirectors act the same as manual ones, except you can quickly provision and terminate them from this panel. Note that cloud redirectors are provisioned in your attached cloud account and may incur normal usage charges.
